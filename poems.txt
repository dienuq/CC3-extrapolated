Be perfect, make it otherwise.
Yesterday is torn in shreds.
Lightning’s thousand sulfur eyes
Rip apart the breathing beds.
Hear bones crack and pulverize.
Doom creeps in on rubber treads.
Countless overwrought housewives,
Minds unraveling like threads,
Try lipstick shades to tranquilize
Fears of age and general dreads.
Sit tight, be perfect, swat the spies,
Don’t take faucets for fountainheads.
Drink tasty antidotes. Otherwise
You and the werewolf: newlyweds.

The Devil’s tour of hell did not include   
a factory line where molten lead   
spilled into mouths held wide,


no electric drill spiraling screws
into hands and feet, nor giant pliers   
to lower you into simmering vats.


Instead, a circle of light
opened on your stuffed armchair,
whose chintz orchids did not boil and change,


and the Devil adjusted   
your new spiked antennae
almost delicately, with claws curled


and lacquered black, before he spread   
his leather wings to leap   
into the acid-green sky.


So your head became a tv hull,
a gargoyle mirror. Your doppelganger   
sloppy at the mouth


and swollen at the joints   
enacted your days in sinuous   
slow motion, your lines delivered


with a mocking sneer. Sometimes   
the frame froze, reversed, began   
again: the red eyes of a friend


you cursed, your girl child cowered   
behind the drapes, parents alive again   
and puzzled by this new form. That’s why


you clawed your way back to this life.

“Oh where are you going with your love-locks flowing
   On the west wind blowing along this valley track?”
“The downhill path is easy, come with me an it please ye,
   We shall escape the uphill by never turning back.”


So they two went together in glowing August weather,
   The honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right;
And dear she was to dote on, her swift feet seemed to float on
   The air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight.


“Oh what is that in heaven where gray cloud-flakes are seven,
   Where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt?”
“Oh that’s a meteor sent us, a message dumb, portentous,
   An undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt.”


“Oh what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly,
   Their scent comes rich and sickly?”—“A scaled and hooded worm.”
“Oh what’s that in the hollow, so pale I quake to follow?”
   “Oh that’s a thin dead body which waits the eternal term.”


“Turn again, O my sweetest,—turn again, false and fleetest:
   This beaten way thou beatest I fear is hell’s own track.”
“Nay, too steep for hill-mounting; nay, too late for cost-counting:
   This downhill path is easy, but there’s no turning back.”

The mask that burns like a violin, the mask
that sings only dead languages, that loves
the destruction of being put on. The mask
that sighs like a woman even though
a woman wears it. The mask beaded with
freshwater pearls, with seeds. The plumed mask,
the mask with a sutured mouth, a moonface,
with a healed gash that means harvest. A glower
that hides wanting. A grotesque pucker. Here’s
a beaked mask, a braided mask, here’s a mask
without eyes, a mask that looks like a mask
but isn’t—please don’t try to unribbon it.
The mask that snows coins, the mask full of wasps.
Lace mask to net escaping thoughts. Pass me
the rouged mask, the one made of sheet music.
Or the jackal mask, the hide-bound mask
that renders lovers identical with night.

What did they desire, the dead who had returned?
The sons who had inherited their estates
pretended not to know them. The iron gates
were welded shut, but soon the dead had learned


to hire lawyers practiced in the laws
that bound the afterlife to lesser gods.
The angels thundered on like piston rods,
denying their gold wings to either cause.

The city streetlamps flared like learnèd ghosts.
The moon turned red. Beneath a scrim of clouds,
Spanish moss draped the myrtle trees like shrouds—
in politics the guests became the hosts.


Those days made angels of the better sort.
The cases languished in a lower court.

The spirits have dispersed, the woods
faded to grey from midnight blue
leaving a powdery residue,
night music fainter, frivolous gods
withdrawing, cries of yin and yang,
discords of the bionic young;
cobweb and insects, hares and deer,
wild strawberries and eglantine,
dawn silence of the biosphere,
amid the branches a torn wing
— what is this enchanted place?
Not the strict groves of academe
but an old thicket of lost time
too cool for school, recovered space
where the brain yields to nose and ear,
folk remedy and herbal cure,
old narratives of heart and hand,
and a dazed donkey, starry eyed,
with pearls and honeysuckle crowned,
beside her naked nibs is laid.
Wild viruses, Elysian fields —
our own planet lit by the fire
of molten substance, constant flux,
hot ice and acrobatic sex,
the electric moth-touch of desire
and a new vision, a new regime
where the white blaze of physics yields
to yellow moonlight, dance and dream
induced by what mind-altering drug
or rough-cast magic realism;
till morning bright with ant and bug
shines in a mist of glistening gism,
shifting identities, mutant forms,
angels evolved from snails and worms.


My bands of silk and miniver
Momently grew heavier;
The black gauze was beggarly thin;
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;
I could not suck the moonlight in.


Harlequin in lozenges
Of love and hate, I walked in these
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;
Along the pavement my footsoles
Trod warily on living coals.


Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,
In their corrupt disguises clothed,
Morality I could not tear
From my ribs, to leave them bare
Ivory in silver air.


There I walked, and there I raged;
The spiritual savage caged
Within my skeleton, raged afresh
To feel, behind a carnal mesh,
The clean bones crying in the flesh.

I am a spirit, trapped in flesh and bone
A transient being, forever alone
In this mortal coil, where time is fleeting
I am but a guest, my soul incomplete

I walk among you, disguised as one of your kind
But inside, I yearn for the spiritual realm I left behind
The human world is loud and bright
But it cannot quell the eternal fire burning inside

I am a wanderer, searching for my true home
In this mortal shell, I am forced to roam
But my spirit soars, free as the wind
It remembers a time when it was not confined

I am a spirit, caught in a human world
But my soul is bound to an ancient, timeless scroll
I may be trapped in this flesh and blood
But my spirit will always be where it should

So I carry on, through joy and pain
Hoping one day, to be free again
To return to the place where I truly belong
To the realm of the spirits, where I'll be reunited with my own.

Here is a poem about being a spirit trapped in a human world:

I am a spirit, trapped in flesh
A foreign being, in this human mesh
I long to fly, to soar and soar
But these heavy limbs, they hold me to the floor

I see the world, through human eyes
But my spirit's vision, it never dies
I feel the air, on human skin
But my spirit's essence, it lies within

I taste the food, with human tongue
But my spirit's hunger, it can't be stung
I hear the sounds, with human ears
But my spirit's music, it never clears

I am a spirit, trapped in time
A wanderer, in this earthly clime
I long to break free, from this mortal coil
But until then, I'll simply toil

I am a spirit, in a human guise
But my true self, it never dies
I'll make the most, of this earthly lease
Until my spirit's, final release

I've lived many lives, on this mortal plane
Each one a journey, with its own refrain
But through all the years, and all the pain
I never found, my soulmate's reign

But then one day, in this lifetime's quest
I met you, and my heart did arrest
Your eyes, they shone, like stars in the night
I knew then, our souls had taken flight

We've traveled far, through time and space
Together and apart, in different place
But no matter where, our paths have led
Our bond has stayed, strong and unbroken, like steel

And now I know, that you are the one
My soulmate, through lifetimes and beyond
I'll love you always, in every life
For you, my soulmate, are the light of my life

I lie here, on my deathbed
My time on earth, soon to end
I close my eyes, and let go
Of all the pain, and all the woe

I feel my spirit, rising up
Leaving my body, empty and sup
I see a light, in the distance
And towards it, I take my instance

I float through space, weightless and free
No longer bound, by gravity
I see my life, flash before my eyes
All the joys, and all the lies

I see the ones, I've left behind
Their tears and sorrow, intertwined
But I am at peace, with my fate
For my spirit, can't be late

I join the ancestors, in the great beyond
Where love and light, forever bond
I am at home, in this spiritual realm
No longer bound, to earthly helm

I am a spirit, free to roam
Unencumbered, by earthly dome
I watch over, my loved ones here
And offer guidance, through their fear

I am not gone, just changed form
My love and presence, still warm
I'll always be with, those I hold dear
Even as a spirit, my love is clear

So don't mourn, my passing on
For I am not gone, just moved along
I am a spirit, eternal and bright
Watching over, with love and light
